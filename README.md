This is my configuration setup for the Awesome Tiling Wm.
(http://awesome.naquadah.org/)

## IDEAS
I like the concept of tiling WM, and use it happily since a few years,
and Awesome is fast, efficient and straightforward.

I also really endorse UNIX phylosophy: «Make each program do one thing well.»
see : http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html

## Features
So I try to also do it on my WM:
- Keep clear configuration around each need of the config.
- Keep every module in the bundle directory, big fan of NeoBundle https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim

## Toolbar
Actually on my toolbar:
* NetWidget:   Display the network status.
* MemWidget:   Display the memory usage.
* CpuWidget:   Display the load of the CPU.
* TempWidget:  Display temp information.
* SoundWidget: Display the sound level (PulseAudio support).
* BatWidget:   Display the information of available bat of the system.
* DateWidget:  Display the date.
* TimeWidget:  Display the current time.
